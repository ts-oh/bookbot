## Options 📚

You can use your own text file to parse using the book bot. Simply copy your text file inside the `./books` directory.

<s>Open main.py in your editor and assign the `book_path` variable with your text file `"./books/YOUR_TEXT_FILE.txt"`

It should look like this `book_path = "./books/YOUR_TEXT_FILE.txt"`

Once it's assigned, save it and run the script as instructed in installation section.</s>

**Update:** Now it will prompt you to type out the name of the text file that you would like
to parse. Just simply keep your text files in the `./books` directory like before.
